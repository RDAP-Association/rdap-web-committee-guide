questions:
  - question: 'How can I request a new web feature or web page?'
    answer: 'For complicated requests that require planning (e.g., new events, IA changes, new pages, etc.) send an email to the web chair(s) via their personal emails.'
  - question: 'How can I or my committee test a web feature?'
    answer: 'The web team has developed a "test group" proceedure so Wild Apricot admin can test features of the site before they go live. This has been a successful way to ensure event registration forms work as intended. Email the web chair(s) if you would like to initiate a test group.'
  - question: 'Can I have a blank page to use as a "testing sandbox"?'
    answer: 'Yes! The web team can create pages in Wild Apricot that are not visible to the public. These can be used to test out new features and widgets. Email the web chair(s) if your committee would like a sandbox page.'
