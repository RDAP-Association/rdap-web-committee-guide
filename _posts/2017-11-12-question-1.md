questions:
  - question: 'Send quick messages through Slack?'
    answer: 'Quick messages might be content updates, standing event requests, and most Wild Apricot questions, or request access to admin features in Wild Apricot. the best way to contact us about anything that might have a quick answer is the #web channel in Slack. Slack is also best if you are updating the web team about something or otherwise letting us know something.'
  - question: 'Email chairs about complicated topics'
    answer: 'For complicated requests (e.g., a new webpage that will effect the site's information architecture, new event requests, a feature request, or a request that hasn't been made in the past) send an email to the web chair(s) via their personal emails.'
  - question: 'Direct non-leadership RDAP members to the Webmaster Gmail'
    answer: 'If you are trying to connect someone who is not a part of RDAP leadership to the web team, send them to the webmaster@rdapassociation.org email (This SOP needs to be approved by the group).'
